# About dataset

Context
This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1]. The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

Content
The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known minefield (and known rocks).
These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine).
name:-sonar.csv

# operation(main file) is done in file name:-mine vs rock detecting

# Report
all the profile report of the dataset is generate and
saved in html format name:-pakinson's disease prediction using ml
